# Visual Odometry for Maze Navigation

## Description
This is the project for the graduate class ROB-GY 6203 Robot Perception at NYU Tandon SOE between Panayiotis Christou, Jesse Inouye and Ifedayo Olasunya.  
In this project we are tasked to explore a maze created using textures as in PyGame to find the target images. The project is split in 2 phases, the exploration and navigation phase.
The goal of the project is for the team members to implement computer vision techniques, either classical or deep learning, to detect the images and to be able to navigate back to them in navigation phase.
